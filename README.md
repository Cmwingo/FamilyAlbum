# Family Album

A web portal focused on facilitating interactions with family

## Description

With all the social media distractions and obligations, Family Album is a place that allows one to focus on those closest to us, our families. First and foremost, Family Album is just that, a family photoalbum. Users can upload their favorite photos and share them with the family. Each photo is stored in a digital photo album with a description of the contents and the date range those photos fall under. Users may also take advantage of the family message board where family members can post important announcements about upcomming family events or even recount stories about their favorite family memories. Private messaging between family members is also available for topics of more narrow interest.
